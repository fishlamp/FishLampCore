@class FLLinkedListMutableEnumerator;

/// @brief FLLinkedList is a class for fast linked lists. 
/// This linked list is good for specific things and is not really
/// a general purpose collection. The idea is that you have control
/// over the storage of each element in a list.
///
/// For example, if you had a list of sprites that are FLLinkedListElement objects 
/// (e.g. your not allocating some kind of container, or if you are, you're cacheing that container)
/// If done correctly, you can remove/add/change list without any memory allocation penalties. 
/// 
/// It's also super fast to iterate forward and back in and has a low cost for inserts and deletes.
///
/// Searches, however, are expensive. Log(n). Careful here.
///
/// We have some experimental sorting in which could potentially help, but since the the list
/// don't support indexing, our hands are tied.
/// 
/// Use this is a case where you're doing a lot of inserts and removals, and
/// you need a fast stack/queue that you don't want a lot of memory allocations
/// happening.
///
/// Mutation during fast enumeration is not supported, but you can mutate during iteration with the standard linked list iteration.
/// For example:
///     id walker = list.firstObject;
///     while(walker) {
///         id next = walker.nextObjectInLinkedList;
///         [list removeObject:walker];
///         walker = next;
///     }
/// But be careful, it would be easy to hork yourself.
